The interface is a website that allows the user to select choices
in their day which influence their stress level. By the end of the game the user
has successfully spent a day in their life and are prompted to refresh or 
they have reached burnout and are guided to reflect on choices that
could help them avoid/treat burnout. We were inspired to create thiis project
due to the stress that college students like us experience and skills we can
develop over time to manage burnout.

Instructions: Open the home.html file. Follow the prompts and
make your own choices until you reach an end page determining whether you
reached burnout.

Code structure: Since we used HTML, we have a main HTML file
a CSS file and script.js file. We divded the workload into multiple scenes
and used similar functions to code for components within each scene such as buttons, connecting
screens, background images, and in game features (i.e. the stress bar).
