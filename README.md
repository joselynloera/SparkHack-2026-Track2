Multiple studies have reported high levels of distress in college students. 
Long term stress leads to burnout. It is useful to conceptualize burn-out as being one of the actions that induce anxiety and depression. With some studies finding 30% of university students showing depression symptoms and 15% having had suicidal thoughts in the past 12 months. Our game explores how students can maintain work life balance by making sound choices throughout the day. In order to better understand the nature of burn-out, the choices present in the game were based on the research we conducted on common strategies and actions students can take to prevent and treat burn-out when it does occur.

The interface is a website that allows the user to select choices
in their day which influence their stress level. By the end of the game the user
has successfully spent a day in their life and are prompted to refresh or 
they have reached burnout and are guided to reflect on choices that
could help them avoid/treat burnout. We were inspired to create this project
due to the stress that college students like us experience and skills we can
develop over time to manage burnout.

Instructions: Open the home.html file. Follow the prompts and
make your own choices until you reach an end page determining whether or not you
reached burnout.

Code structure: Since we used HTML, we have a main HTML file
a CSS file and script.js file. We divded the workload into multiple scenes
and used similar functions to code for components within each scene such as buttons, connecting
screens, background images, and in game features (i.e. the stress bar).
