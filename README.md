The interface is a website that allows the user to select choices
in their day which influence their stress level. By the end of the game the user
has successfully spent a day in their life and are prompted to refresh or 
they have reached burnout and are guided to reflect on choices that
could help them avoid/treat burnout. We were inspired to create thiis project
due to the stress that college students like us experience and skills we can
develop over time to manage burnout.
